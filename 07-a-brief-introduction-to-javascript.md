# What Is JavaScript and What Can We Do With It?

## Introduction

You’ve already written a line or two of JavaScript — but **what exactly is JavaScript**, and **what can we actually do with it**?

That’s what this lecture is all about.

This video is especially important because it **sets the foundation for the entire course**, so it’s worth following all the way through.

## Defining JavaScript

JavaScript can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is:

> **JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.**

At first glance, that definition sounds pretty intimidating — so let’s break it down into something that actually makes sense.

---

## What Is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is simply a tool that allows us to write code that **instructs a computer to do something**.

And that’s exactly why we use JavaScript:

* To tell computers (and browsers) what to do
* To create behavior, logic, and interaction

---

## JavaScript Is a High-Level Language

JavaScript is a **high-level language**, which means:

* We don’t have to manage the computer’s memory ourselves
* We don’t need to worry about many low-level technical details
* The language provides **abstractions** that hide complexity

👉 These abstractions make JavaScript:

* Easier to learn
* Faster to write
* More beginner-friendly

---

## JavaScript Is Object-Oriented

JavaScript is also **object-oriented**.

This means:

* Most data in JavaScript is stored and organized using **objects**
* Objects help structure data and behavior together

You’ll learn object-oriented programming in depth throughout the course — for now, it’s enough to know that objects are a core building block of JavaScript.

---

## JavaScript Is Multi-Paradigm

JavaScript is a **multi-paradigm language**, which means it’s very flexible.

You can write JavaScript using different programming styles, such as:

* **Imperative programming**
* **Declarative programming**

These paradigms are simply **different ways of structuring and thinking about code**.

You don’t need to master them right now — this is just a high-level overview.

## JavaScript’s Role in Web Development

Now that we have a basic idea of what JavaScript is, let’s talk about **what it’s actually used for**.

### The Three Core Technologies of the Web

Modern websites are built using **three core technologies**:

1. **HTML** – Content
2. **CSS** – Presentation
3. **JavaScript** – Behavior

They work together to create **beautiful, interactive, and dynamic websites**.

---

### HTML: The Content

HTML is responsible for:

* Text
* Images
* Buttons
* All visible content on a webpage

Everything you see on a webpage starts as HTML.

---

### CSS: The Presentation

CSS controls:

* Styling
* Layout
* Colors
* Fonts
* Spacing

In short, CSS decides **how things look**.

---

### JavaScript: The Behavior

JavaScript is the **programming language of the web**.

It allows developers to:

* Add interactivity
* Create dynamic effects
* Manipulate HTML and CSS
* Load data from servers
* Build full web applications in the browser

---

## A Helpful Analogy: Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs

To make the roles clearer, here’s a simple analogy:

* **HTML = Nouns**

  * Example: “This is a paragraph”

* **CSS = Adjectives**

  * Example: “The paragraph is red”

* **JavaScript = Verbs**

  * Example: “Hide the paragraph”

JavaScript **does things** — it makes the page react and change.

---

## Real-World Example: Twitter

Let’s look at a real web application: **Twitter**.

When you open a Twitter profile page:

* Loading spinners appear
* Data is fetched in the background
* Content appears dynamically
* Styles change automatically

All of this is powered by **JavaScript**.

### Examples of JavaScript in Action on Twitter

* Loading data from Twitter’s servers
* Hiding spinners when data arrives
* Showing and hiding the tweet box
* Displaying user info on hover
* Loading data dynamically as needed

This is JavaScript manipulating:

* Content
* Styles
* User interactions

And by the end of the course, you’ll know how to build things like this yourself.

---

## Why JavaScript Is So Important

JavaScript allows us to:

* Add dynamic effects to websites
* Build full web applications in the browser
* Create apps that feel like native desktop or mobile apps

👉 JavaScript is what made **modern web development possible**.

---

## JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

You may have heard of:

* **React**
* **Angular**
* **Vue**

These are modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks that:

* Make large-scale applications easier to build
* Improve speed and maintainability

### Important Note

All of these tools are:

* **100% based on JavaScript**

That’s why it’s critical to:

* Learn **JavaScript itself first**
* Not jump into frameworks too early

Frameworks change.
JavaScript fundamentals last.

👉 Learning JavaScript well is one of the **best investments** you can make in a web development career.

---

## JavaScript Beyond the Browser

JavaScript and the browser are **not the same thing**.

JavaScript can also run:

* On web servers
* Outside the browser

### Example: Node.js

* Runs JavaScript on servers
* Used to build backend applications
* Interacts with databases and APIs

### Front-End vs Back-End

* **Front-end:** JavaScript in the browser
* **Back-end:** JavaScript on servers (Node.js)

This course focuses primarily on **front-end JavaScript**.

---

## JavaScript for Mobile and Desktop Apps

JavaScript can also be used to build:

* Native mobile apps
* Desktop applications

Thanks to tools like:

* React Native
* Ionic
* Electron

These tools have transformed the industry and expanded what’s possible with JavaScript.

👉 There’s very little you *can’t* build once you’re really good at JavaScript.

## JavaScript Versions and Releases

To wrap up, let’s briefly talk about JavaScript versions.

### ES2015 (ES6)

* A major update released in 2015
* Officially called **ES2015**
* Commonly known as **ES6**
* “ES” stands for **ECMAScript**

### Modern JavaScript

* Since ES2015, JavaScript has:

  * Yearly updates
  * New features every year
* Everything from ES2015 onward is considered **modern JavaScript**

---

## What This Course Teaches

In this course:

* You’ll learn **modern JavaScript from the start**
* You’ll also learn important concepts from **pre-ES2015 (ES5)** for full understanding
* A dedicated video later explains JavaScript versions in detail
